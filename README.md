My First Program is a simple C++ program that calculates the sum of two numbers, 90 and 88, and displays the result with the phrase: 'ANJAYYY BENEER :)'. This program is intended to practice basic programming concepts, such as the use of variables, operators, and the output function (cout). It marks my first step into the world of coding."
